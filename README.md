WebAssembly builds for Stockfish.

This package is optimized for the lichess.org website, which needs multiple builds and chess variants. It is not straight-forward to load and use.

Check out https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js for a simpler browser Stockfish.

## Building

```
# Example: Clean and make all web targets
./build.py all clean
```

Use `--cxx` to override the default emcc flags which are `-O3 -DNDEBUG --closure=1`.

Use `--ld` to override default linker flags (`--ld='-sENVIRONMENT=node'` to target node).

Check `./build.py --help` for the latest targets

To avoid installing or changing your emscripten version, use `./build-with-docker.sh` or `./build-with-podman.sh`:

```
# Example: Docker clean and make all targets for node as debug with SAFE_HEAP
./build-with-docker.sh --cxx='-O0 -g3 -sSAFE_HEAP' --ld='-sENVIRONMENT=node' all clean

# Example: clean and make dist targets for web with a preallocated pthread pool size of 8
./build.py --ld='-sENVIRONMENT=web,worker -sPTHREAD_POOL_SIZE=8' clean dist
```

`./build.py` downloads sources to the `./fishes` folder then applies diffs from the `./patches` folder.
Edit the Stockfish sources within `./fishes`. Contribute your edits via patch file

```
# Example: Update `sf_17.1.patch` with your source changes:
cd fishes/sf_17.1
git diff > ../../patches/sf_17.1.patch
```

## Run locally on node

```
./build.py --ld='-sENVIRONMENT=node'
node ./src/wasm-cli.js ./sf_18.js
uci
```

Check the output of `uci` for the correct nnue names and download ones you don't have from https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns

Now you'll have to load the nnues. (see `./src/wasm-cli.js`).

```
big ./nn-c288c895ea92.nnue
small ./nn-37f18f62d772.nnue
```

_The specific file names might change, so check the output of `uci` for the correct names._
